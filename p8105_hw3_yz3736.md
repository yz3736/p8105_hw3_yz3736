This is my solution to Homework 3.

# Question 1

### Part 1: Write a short description of the dataset

Note the size and structure of the data, describing some key variables,
and giving illustrative examples of observations.

``` r
data("instacart")
```

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns. Observations are the
level of items in orders by user. There are user / order variables –
user ID, order ID, order day, and order hour. There are also item
variables – name, aisle, department, and some numeric codes.

### Part 2: Do or answer the following questions

1)  How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items
    ordered from?

<!-- end list -->

``` r
instacart %>% 
    count(aisle) %>% 
    arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 x 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # … with 124 more rows

There are 134 aisles. Most items are ordered from fresh vegetables
aisle.  

2)  Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
    limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
    aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
instacart %>% 
    count(aisle) %>% 
    filter(n > 10000) %>%
    mutate(
        aisle = factor(aisle),
        aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)
    ) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
    geom_point() + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_yz3736_files/figure-gfm/aisle_plot-1.png" width="90%" />

Top three aisles with the most items are fresh vegetables, fresh fruits
and packaged vegetables/fruits.  

3)  Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the
    aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged
    vegetables fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered
    in your table.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
instacart %>% 
    filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
    group_by(aisle) %>% 
    count(product_name) %>%
    mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
    filter(rank < 4) %>% 
    arrange(aisle, rank) %>% 
    knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product\_name                                 |    n | rank |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | ---: | ---: |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |

Top 3 popular items from baking ingredients are Light Brown Sugar, Pure
Baking Soda and Cane Sugar; top 3 popular items from dog food care are
Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats, Organix Chicken & Brown
Rice Recipe and Small Dog Biscuits; top 3 popular items from packaged
vegetables fruits are Organic Baby Spinach, Organic Raspberries and
Organic Blueberries.  

4)  Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
    Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week;
    format this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).

<!-- end list -->

``` r
instacart %>% 
    filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>% 
    group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
    summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
    pivot_wider(
        names_from = order_dow,
        values_from = mean_hour
    ) %>% 
    knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'product_name' (override with `.groups` argument)

| product\_name    |        0 |        1 |        2 |        3 |        4 |        5 |        6 |
| :--------------- | -------: | -------: | -------: | -------: | -------: | -------: | -------: |
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77419 | 14.31579 | 15.38095 | 15.31818 | 15.21739 | 12.26316 | 13.83333 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44118 | 11.36000 | 11.70213 | 14.25000 | 11.55172 | 12.78431 | 11.93750 |

By looking at table of the mean hour of the day at which products are
ordered, Pink Lady Apples are order earlier than Coffee Ice Cream in a
day for each day of the day.

# Question 2

### Part 1: Read and clean accelerometers data

``` r
accel_df = 
    read_csv(
        "./data/accel_data.csv") %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    activity.1:activity.1440,
    names_to = "minute",
    names_prefix = "activity.",
    values_to = "activity"
  )
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_double(),
    ##   day = col_character()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.
