This is my solution to Homework 3! 

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .6,
  out.width = "90%"
)
theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))
options(
  ggplot2.continuous.colour = "viridis",
  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "viridis"
)
scale_colour_discrete = scale_color_viridis_d
scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d
```
